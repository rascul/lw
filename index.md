The Andoran Queen's Guardsmen known as the Lion Warden are a group of
soldiers, loyal to the Queen unto death, who patrol the lands of Andor,
seeking criminals and thieves and generally upholding the peace. Recently,
the Warden is known to have put down the rebel group known as the Iron Fist
who had established themselves deep in southwest Andor. Ardent believers in
justice, the ranks of the Warden are open to all those who lead a righteous
lifestyle.

Recently, the Lion Warden have found a pair of white lion cubs, previously
believed to be extinct.
