Andor will allow hunting by Far Madding without permission being invoked. Andor
still holds the right to end hunting within the city should it consider it
necessary for peace and good order. Lion Warden, especially senior Wardens are
still in charge of the peace and order in the city of Andor.

Far Madding will allow hunting, of any unclanned criminal, in all of the
territory that it encompasses save from the city of Far Madding itself. This is
due to a particular ancient custom about peace within the city walls. Once again
Far Madding holds the right to end hunting if it seems necessary for peace and
order.
