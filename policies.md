Below are some policies a Lion Warden must abide by.

## Minimum Time Length Before Pardon Quest

   *  Note: You must post in the Warrant/Pardon thread whenever a warrant is issued or a pardon is granted.  
   *  Note: These only apply to times before pardon quests can be granted. If a warrant is appealed, the appeal process
      trumps this and is to be given immediate priority.
   *  Murder: 1 month
   *  Theft, Attacking: 1 week (banishment or warrant, up to Lion Warden on duty)
   *  Physical attacks on a Lion Warden: 2 weeks

## Dockable Offenses

   *  Taking items from the chest and not posting it within 24 hours (2qps, repeat offenses will be higher)
   *  Not wearing clan cloak at all times
   *  Insulting higher ranking members (you can disagree without insulting)
   *  Officers (Rank 5+) must be wearing at least one pair of golden braids as expected of their rank

## Incognito

   *  If you plan on being incognito, you must have Lion Warden in your title.
