The crier is found in the City Square.

1. Huge drooling rats are a damm plague round here, bring me a scalp!

2. I need a belladonna berry for the herbalist. Look south of the city and bring me one.

3. I hear of stags somewhere near here. I like venison - find them and bring me a scalp!

4. Governor Adan, he's misplaced his pipe, he last had it before bed, apparently. Give it to me.
