The crier in Whitebridge is found in the Magnificent Square.

1. I'm hungry. Fetch me a potato, please.

2. My headache is awful. I'd like some willow-bark to make me feel better.

3. There are some bloodstained papers nearby that I need.

4. Lastly - big black rats. I hate them! HATE THEM! Get me a scalp.
