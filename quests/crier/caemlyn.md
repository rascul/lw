Caemlyn Central Square is where the crier can be found.

1. Rats are a damm plague round the city, bring me a scalp!

2. I need an oilstone for the weaponsmith. Look south of the city and bring me one.

3. Too many thieves around. At least our forces have frightened one - bring me his scalp!

4. Basel, he's lost his spectacles, near those Aringill woods, apparently. Give them to me.
