You may complete these quests once, unless specified otherwise.

The mysterious lady can be found in the Meeting Hall. Ask her to `issue quest`.

1. We need to improve the speed of our communications.
   Bring me a quill pen, a sheet of paper, a pigeon egg, a sack of grain and a
   bone cylinder.
   
2. The Shadow threatens the land.
   Bring me the heads of six goat-faced trollocs.
   
3. The Shadow seeks to employ a new weapon against the Light.
   Kill one of these hideous abominations.

4. Dougan is a threat to all of us. Remove his thread from the Pattern.

5. A darkfriend cell is hiding in the southwest. Bring me the heads of these
   betrayers.

6. We should strengthen our ties to the Ogier in case we need their masonry
   skills. Visit the Stedding and see if they need your service.

7. I'm looking for a statuette of Artur Hawkwing. Perhaps Sarita the antiques
   dealer can help you locate one.

8. The Seanchan are ambitious fools, but dangerous nonetheless. Their ambition
   to conquer the lands and leash those who can channel can threaten the fight
   against the Shadow. Word has it that the Seanchan seek to acquire more a'dam,
   the leashes they use to control channelers. They have reportedly made contact
   with someone who can provide them with the right material. Find an a'dam and
   show it to a jeweler so that we may deduct who that contact is. Find this
   contact and make a better offer.

9. Bows are a great tool for killing. Find a bowyer and acquire a longbow.
