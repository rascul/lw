Queen Morgase, when not in the Throne Room, may be found east of the Throne Room.
Ask her to `issue quest`.

1. It is paramount that we maintain a show of strength
   in the face of those who would test our resolve and fortitude.
   For every criminal permanently warranted who receives Andoran
   justice through you, you shall be amply rewarded.
   Simply mail me and note the criminal is PERMANENTLY WARRANTED
   and you shall receive extra compensation from the Crown.
   Criminals will no longer find it safe to defy Andor.
   In addition, criminals or shadowspawn you apprehend on
   on Andoran soil receive additional compensation as well.

2. In the hills north of Caemlyn, dark creatures have taken up residence.
   Reports have reached me of one particularly evil creature.
   Cloaked in shadows, this knight is rumored to be quite hard to kill.
   Nonetheless, I have no doubt that you can manage.
   Dispatch of this creature and bring me his head.

3. To the north lie the black hills which provide countless
   places for criminals and villains to seek refugee.
   Dark spirits are rumored to have infested a ruined manor
   in the northern foothills, to the west of Tar Valon.
   Reports indicate that the Lord of these foul spirits guards
   a chest of some type with his followers.
   Dispose of the leader, find the key to his chest, and return
   it to me so I can examine it further.

4. Lord Captain Tallanvor sends troubling tidings from Whitebridge.
   It appears the bandit Ragnor has gone into hiding just to
   the west of the city, deep inside underground tunnels.
   Bandits must not be tolerated anywhere within Andor.
   You will seek out this man and bring him to justice.
   Return to me with proof of his demise so we may make an example of him.

5. It troubles me deeply to know that Shadowspawn sometimes raid
   our borders and occasionally venture into the heart of Andor.
   However, the thought of Shadowspawn taking up residence is unbearable.
   I have had several reports of myrddraal setting up fortifications
   in different locations within my realm. This simply cannot be.
   I have heard of two different camps - one outside Whitebridge and
   one just to the north of the city of Lugard, along the road.
   Seek out these filth and bring me proof of their demise, but take
   care in this mission for the blood of the eyeless is dangerous.

6. Though the seanchan invaders are no threat to Andor, we cannot
   ignore the plights of our neighbors nor their efforts.
   If our allies to the west were to fall, nothing remains
   to deter the seanchan from invading Andor.
   I am told the invaders have a camp just south of Emonds Field.
   Investigate this for me and dispose of the man leading them.
