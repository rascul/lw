### Portal Stones <small>2qps</small>
> <smaller>I have been informed that there are several very powerful Ter’angreal positioned
> across the world. They look like stone columns. Studies show that only those who
> possess the ability to wield the one power can activate them. So far a few have
> been found. Accepted Delilah has approached me and kindly asked if we can help
> by finding more for her studies. A risky job for her so I gladly accepted this
> mission on your behalf.
> I task you into finding 5 of these Ter’angreal. I will require the region of
> where you came across the stones with a detailed room description of each. Mail
> your findings to me and of course you will be rewarded.</smaller>

### Ocean Ships (Part 1) <small>2qps</small>
> <smaller>There are currently 9 ships that are able to sail the Ocean, I would like the
> name of 7 of these ships. You will also need to provide me with how many ports
> there are; the room names, the region and the description of the room for each
> port. This will prove quite valuable to the economy, imagine how much our
> country would flourish if we had this information. Andor thrives as it is, but
> with the knowledge of how to navigate the ocean, our nation’s wealth will be
> vast.</smaller>


### Ocean Ships (Part 2) <small>2qps</small>
> <smaller>An extra 2 quest points will be rewarded if you can give me the names, region,
> room names and room descriptions of the last 2 ships and the 2 ports.</smaller>


### Within the Ways (Part 1) <small>3qps</small>
> <smaller>After Visiting the city of Tar Valon my equipped charger and I headed west out
> the gate. It had been a long day, night had fallen and my bunk in the barracks
> was waiting for me. Somehow after leaving the city I had wandered off my path. I
> tracked my way around trying to find the road again but it was too dark and I
> grew tired. With a sigh my weariness got the better of me and I decided to set
> up camp among some scattered birch and dogwoods. Daybreak, the morning was cool
> with specks of light dancing with the sway of the trees. Gathering myself
> together I stood rubbing my eyes. As my eyes focused something caught my
> attention. An intricately carved stone Avendesora leaf was wedged into what
> looked like a door. Strange, I didn’t know why a door would be here. Curious I
> moved closer to examine it, touching the leaf I pulled it thinking I could take
> it home with me. The most bizarre thing happened; a strange portal opens out of
> seemingly nowhere.</smaller>

> <smaller>I looked south towards home and then back at the portal. I never went home that
> day; months later I emerged even further away from home. I was safe but had seen
> so much within a short amount of time. I had been across the globe in less than
> a few months; I saw evil things Trollocs, rats, black wind whispering and
> rushing with sinister songs. I heard the ominous winds that carried screams,
> howling and melodies to die for... I questioned my own sanity; at one point I do
> believe I went mad. Finally I arrive home where I was greeted by Nalav who
> stared at me and said...Tough day huh? I almost passed out when Nalav caught me
> and promptly sent word to our local wisdom. Not sure what happened after that
> but I assure you all is well now. </smaller>


### The Stone of Sorrows (Part 2) <small>2qps</small>
> <smaller>Among my things I picked up a small stone, like a pebble. Rolling it around in
> my hands I began to feel a sense of sadness, shaking the feeling off I tossed it
> aside, I vaguely remember where I found it.</smaller>

> <smaller>(ooc: Retrace my adventure, there are 8 way gates. I require the region, room
> names and room descriptions of where each gate is located. An extra 2 quest
> points is given if you find the Stone of Sorrows.)</smaller>


### Finding Kerrigan <small>3qps</small>
> <smaller>I was traveling through the south the other day, and was accosted by Seanchan
> warriors. A woman came to my aid, Kerrigan I think it was. I wanted to thank her
> for what she did for me; I was told that she can be seen roaming different
> places where she offers assistance. Please find out where she could be found.
> (Ooc: At least 2 areas where she can be found.)</smaller>


### Dorthy's Key <small>2qps</small>
> <smaller>I was gigging in the marshes for flounder with an old country boy from
> Illian. Needless to say we were drinking and I lost a key in the swamp near a
> lot of Woad's. I feel like it might be there in the muck, it could also be
> covered in slime if you happen to find it.</smaller>


### The tall thief <small>3qps</small>
> <smaller>I heard a thief was receiving stolen goods from Andoran Caravans, he's a tall
> man. The spine of the world, of all places is home to his operations. Ask

> strange man whose been attacking visitors near the Inn. Check the alleyways and

### Muffins! <small>2qps</small>
> <smaller>While you're in Illian, Tallanvor has grown fond of tasty muffins. I heard a
> farmer's wife makes the best in the country towards the valley of kings. Find
> these muffins and bring them to a guard in Caemlyn and the exchange.</smaller>
