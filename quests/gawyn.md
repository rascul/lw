Prince Gawyn may be found in the Throne Room.

### Quest

Ask Prince Gawyn to `issue quest`.

1. An Andoran lord has been found dead in his home.
   Nothing is certain yet, but it looks like murder.
   I want you to lead an investigation.
   The corpse is still in the lord's residence.
   You'll find it in the south western part of the inner city.
   Just let the guard know you wish to enter the scene of the crime.
   Bring the purpetrator to me when you have proof.

### Testing

Ask Prince Gawyn about `testing`.

1. There are 46 names on the list of people permanently wanted by Andor.
   These people, for reasons that escape all logic and reason, still breathe.
   End at least three of their miserable lives, and bring me proof of it.
   You will need to submit a written report to me as to how they met their deaths, or it will not count.

2. My belief is that we are here to protect Andor, not other nations.
   And as such, I want trollocs, fades, dreadlords and invaders killed on Andoran soil.
   Once they cross a border, it is no longer Andor's problem.
   Bring me the kills you make clearly on Andoran soil, and document it clearly.
   I expect at least ten.

3. There will be times when I call for specific aid in the defense of Andor.
   I will be keeping track of who responds the fastest, and who actually gets out into the field in Andor's name.
   I will expect you to be the leader of groups of at least four people.
   Lead to victory, and you will be successful. Otherwise...
