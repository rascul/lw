The current Enlistment Officer is __Mhaliah__.

### Requirements

*  At least level 25, and must be working towards level 30
*  Must be in good standing with Andor
*  If another country has a warrant for the applicant, it will be examined on a case by case basis
*  No channelers will be accepted

### Process

The future applicant will make the initial contact with a Lion Warden of rank Lieutenant or higher 
to show interest. Any Lion Warden not of appropriate rank will direct the person to someone who is. 
A brief interview will be conducted and the recruitment process will be outlined.

### Basics

*  Submit an application letter
*  Complete 6 quests
*  Gain 3 recommendations from Lion Wardens of rank Lieutenant or higher
*  Voting

### Initial Stage

The applicant has sent an application and after sufficient time is given for input about the application,
a rank 4+ Lion Warden will tell them to put {Lion Warden Applicant} in their title. They may then begin 
the 5 tasks listed below which you will have to tell them about. These tasks can be turned in to any Lion 
Warden unless specified rank 4+ and you are to post that they have completed them on the applicantâ€™s thread.

### Tasks

All tasks are to be verified by a rank 4+ Lion Warden. If no Lion Warden is available, a log will suffice 
and must be mailed to the current Recruitment Officer.

*  Find patrols and guards in the countryside and provide information on whether they move and where they would move to.
*  Find two lords in the countryside
*  Slay the smuggler by the name of Roland
*  Acquire a trophy of a golem slain in the Black Hills
*  Slay the bandit by the name of Ragnor
*  Acquire a trophy of the shifty ogier slain in the old Iron Fist base

### Secondary Stage

After the completion of all 5 tasks, the applicant must then grain 3 recommendations from rank 4+ Lion
Warden. Once the recommendations are completed, the voting process begins. To clan the applicant needs 
a minimum of 3 yes votes. If the applicant receives 2 or more no votes, then they will be refused the 
right to clan. Voting will be held for a period of one week, which may be extended if officers believe 
more time is required.

### Notes

*  The quests offer a means of justifying a knowledge of the land and some basic skills.
*  When giving a rec to someone, consider how they come across as a person and whether they're keen or 
   not. Don't just base your recs off player competency.
*  We already use zone knowledge tests for ranks as a safety net to ensure our members are learning what 
   they don't know if they don't know it.
*  Don't give a rec to someone if you don't like them or you don't think you will get along with them 
   and make an effort to get to know them.

### Mentors/Apprentices

Lion Wardens of rank 5+ are able to take up an apprentice after an initial application is lodged. This 
would not make the process easier for the applicant as the process would be the same for a non-apprenticed 
applicant. However, the mentor would take on the responsibility of ensuring they have what it takes to 
be a Lion Warden. This would also mean that a clan vote or recs could not commence until the mentor believed 
the applicant/apprentice was ready. Of course the applicant would have to agree to become your apprentice 
if you asked.

### Enlistment Ceremony

Once all requirements and the vote is complete and the applicant has passed all tests, it is now time to 
enter the applicant into the ranks. Any Senior Lieutenant or higher will be able to do this. Any and all 
available Lion Warden should be present for the ceremony, as well as any friends or family of the applicant.

### Enlistment Oath

_I swear to uphold the laws of Andor for both high born, and low. I swear to administer justice regardless 
of rank or station in the name of Andor. I swear to protect those who need protection, and defend those who 
cannot defend themselves. I swear loyalty to Queen Morgase - bearer of the rose crown, the people and nation 
of Andor, and the Lion Warden - defenders of the realm. Forward the White Lion!_

### New Recruits

Upon clanning, a new recruit must be shown around the palace. Important things are how to issue cloaks and 
quests, who to turn in scalps and quest items to, how to get in the clan room and use the chest, valet, and 
armor. If time permits, provide a tour of the palace, ensuring the new Lion Warden sees all of the clan areas.
Ensure that the newly clanned Lion Warden knows to post on the chest thread.
