2. There are items which are banned in Andor. If you are caught wearing or
   possessing one, you will have one, once again only one, chance to give it up
   peacefully. If you do not, a warrant will be issued and pursued.

   *  Black sword
   *  any armor or equipment of the Shadow or the Seanchan
   *  necklace of human teeth
   *  slave collar.

3. Regarding killing in Andor. All clans have the right to ask to hunt in Andor.
   Permission is to the discretion of the Lion Warden. Anyone caught breaking this
   rule will be banished or warranted depending on the situation.

4. Regarding criminals. Any criminals with warrants are not welcome in Andor. If a
   known criminal enters Andor and attacks anyone residing or passing through, any
   person in Andor has the right to attack them. Note, only known criminals, such
   as Boboliosie. We will not force anyone to attack the criminals, but anyone
   caught aiding or cheering them on will be promptly warranted and killed on
   sight. Nobody is born a criminal. However, in order to protect the citizens of
   Andor, all male channelers are banished. Failure to abide by the banishment will
   result in a warrant until the White Tower and/or the Children or Hand of the
   Light have verified that the person cannot channel and is not a potential threat
   to the safety of Andor.

5. The Lion Warden reserves the right to order anyone in Andor to remove their
   cloak, gloves/gauntlets to check for contraband. We also reserve the right to
   order you to remove your pack and give it to us, once again to check for
   contraband. If you do not comply, you will be banished from Andor. The time of
   the banishment is up to the Lion on duty. Higher ranking Lions have the right to
   overrule any lower ranking Lions.

6. Any warrant or banishment may be appealed. This is a process, and it does not
   gaurantee the warrant or banishment will be lifted. It does, however, ensure
   that the officers of the Lion Warden will investigate the situation and modify
   or remove the punishment if deemed nessecary. Also, anyone who is warranted or
   banished from Andor may submit themselves for execution or jail time, to be
   decided by the Lion Warden on duty, for final punishment. We may or may not
   accept the submission based on facts surrounding the crime or reason for warrant
   or banishment.

7. In addition to the pre stated laws, the Lion Warden is given the highest
   authority in Andor, and in that case may issue warrants and/or banishments to
   those involved in certain actions deemed unfavorable, or illegal, which may not
   be covered in the above laws. This includes, but is not limited to, theft of
   personal property from anyone while inside Andor, slander towards the Queen, the
   country of Andor, or the Lion Warden and it's members, or any sort of verbal or
   sexual assault or harrasment towards any lawful person residing or passing
   through Andor. This decision is to the discretion of the Lion Warden.

8. The Lion Warden control the nation of Andor. Please remember this, we are the
   good Queen's elite guard. We will get the respect we deserve.
